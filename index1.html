    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a jolly, friendly, and amiable person who enjoys exploring and gaining more insights about various domains in the tech world and likes giving my best in whatever I do. I like being  in collaborative environments, loves making friends, and value teamwork. My strong passion lies in coding, technology, and solving real-world problems using logical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m constantly exploring diverse areas of development—from software programming and data structures to software development and architecture. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them in hands-on projects that challenge and grow my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside the tech space, I’m a national-level table tennis player, which has instilled in me qualities like discipline, focus, and consistency—traits I bring into my academic and professional pursuits. I also enjoy watching movies, doing fitness, keeping up with current affairs, and learning different forms of art.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Hotel Table Reservation System</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and develop an automated table reservation system for a hotel that will automatically allocate and reserve tables
based on the no of seats required by clients, send booking notifications to both clients and manager upon successful
reservation, update the availability of tables upon deletion and reservation of admin and periodicallty refresh and display
the current availability of tables</li>
            <li>Designed UI/ UX for the application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and implemented responsive design to ensure
compatibility and integrate frontend with backend API. Used Flask (Python)cfor handling reservations and implement
database schema and queries. Maintained SQL database to create stored procedures and optimize queries</li>
            <li>Achieved smooth and automated deployment , maintained high availability and performance, ensures application security,
scalabilty and reliability, sets up database with proper indexing and constraints, improves user interaction with dynamic
content updates and identify and resolve database- related issues</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>OD Processing System</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a web-based OD (On-Duty) request automation platform using the MERN stack to replace the existing manual process in colleges, streamlining approvals between students, mentors, and faculty.</li>
            <li>Implemented role-based access control, secure login, and real-time status notifications for OD request tracking, ensuring transparency and reducing paperwork and delays.</li>
            <li>Used a Circular Queue data structure to manage OD requests in a fair, cyclic, and memory-efficient manner, enabling first-come, first-served handling and avoiding overflow during peak load times.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Garden Management System</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built a garden management system for systematic management of plants and to take care of its watering, manure.</li>
            <li>Leveraged database management system to handle data storage and retrieval process ensuring that its requirements are
met on time.</li>
            <li>Resulted in higher yields and improved sustainable farming practices.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Task Management System</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed and built a task management system which adds and deletes tasks according to its priority using Flask. It
allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, and uses design patterns like Observer
and Strategy to add flexibility and modularity. Key features include custom sorting, task notifications, and a Restful API
that provides endpoints for task manipulation.</li>
            <li>The Observer pattern allows an object (subject) to maintain a list of dependents (observers) that get notified automatically
when the subject undergoes a change. The Strategy pattern allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating
each one and making them interchangeable. This pattern is used here to enable different sorting strategies for tasks based
on user preferences</li>
            <li>The API offers endpoints for managing tasks, including options for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. It also
allows users to specify sorting preferences</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Meme Generator </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used React/ Flutter for frontend and API, processing (Node.js, Python) for backend, AI models like GPT and Dall-E for
generating text and images and database/ cloud storage to store past memes and generate images.</li>
            <li>Promotes creativity, humour, better communication and advances AI based content creation and innovation.</li>
            <li>Enhances Technical, Operational and Economic Feasibility.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>IOT- Based Early Detection System for Ear- Health Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently working on this hardware IFP project where we have developed a wearable smart earbud with sensors to monitor
ear temperature and pressure.</li>
            <li>Using hardware equipments like earbuds prototyping, temperature and pressure sensors, low cost Bluetooth and cloud
storage and data security for long term data retention and analysis.</li>
            <li>Enhances ear health management and improves overall outcomes by providing real-time data alerts.</li>
        </ul>
